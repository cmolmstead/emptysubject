        <h1 style="color: white;">On the End</h1><p class="posttxt">Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897) stages the vampire as a kind of epistemic uncertainty. The vampire defies the cataloging of our sense-perception. After all, one may gaze into the mirror, but they will not find there a vampire:
Having answered the Count's salutation, I turned to the glass again to see how I had been mistaken. This time there could be no error, for the man was close to me, and I could see him over my shoulder. But there was no reflection of him in the mirror! The whole room behind me was displayed; but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself (32).
In reflection, the vampire is the unseen. The vampire is one of those “trick[s] of the light” (170). Upon a hill, one gazes across the landscape and finds their vision drawn in and captured there upon a rock where the light gleams (101). Yet, they will remain uncertain as to its character with its shadowy figure only given in oblique presence. It is not my intention to read the vampire as simply a monster who escapes taxonomization or as a stand-in for all that which escapes our knowledge. Rather, I intend to show how the vampire is more intimately intertwined with our desire or will to know. To say the vampire is another word for desire should come as no shock; for, it is above all a creature who feeds; “The blood is the life” (152). Further, this is a vampire which stands not beyond the outer edge or limit of our mind’s conceptual extension but is more akin to the black hole at the heart of our desire—a place of excess, lack, and uncertainty. Indeed, one does encounter the vampire in such circumstances of epistemic uncertainty (linguistic, geographic, etc.), in that place where “every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool” (8). A place not only of mystery but where one’s curiosites run most freely. For on the way, one must not forget to “ask the Count” about so many matters (2, 6). So, I intend to say that the nature of the vampire is to be recalcitrant to the knowledge, which is exemplified above all in the distortion of senses which feature in the text.
<br><br>
	I have already tried to foreground the motifs of sight and light in the opening. Light and shadow figure everywhere in the text’s exposition of the mise en scène. In reading these figures in relation to desire, a popular reading might suggest that of the purity of will as embodied in light and the profane or pathological condensed into the shadow, i.e. the vampire as a figure of moral decay. I would rather suggest a situation in which it is not an economy of desire qua pollution but desire as a fundamental point of lack and uncertainty. The case of the former is how one might read the scene of Mina coming to find Lucy in Abbey’s courtyard. I would rather read these shadows for the occluding nature that they so fundamentally are. This is why I privilege the case of the vampire’s inability to appear in a mirror and its marking the vampire’s recalcitrance to the optics and logic of reflection. Again, I seek to frame it as a question of knowledge not of morals. Light and shadow is not an analogous extension of good/evil but knowing/desire. Desire concerns the other side of knowing. The desire to know is what after all drives so many of Stoker’s characters (e.g., Jonathan venturing about the castle, Jack’s work with Renfield and his work with Van Helsing on Lucy, Mina to open Jonathan’s sealed diary).
<br><br>
Upon accepting these terms, the step to the critique of ideology is a short one away. For, it was the elementary idea of ideology which concerned most the logic of reflection (a superstructure reflecting the base, to use the old Marxist model). By ideology, we mean a way of narrating, configuring, and making sense of the world. Ideology is the invisible air we move through imperceptibly structuring our world. Ideology often takes the shape of a fantasy form, an imagined, projected, desired way of being in the world. All the more alike are the vampire and ideology, as in either case we must ask whose lure it is that we are caught in, the gravity of whose desire do we move in? (Perhaps this question too accounts for all the marital angst in the novel.) Indeed, it was Marx who first supplied the metaphor of the vampire for capitalist ideology critique. In Capital (1867), he writes, “Capital is dead labor, which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks” (Chapter 10). But while Marx emphasizes the aspect of parasitic bloodlust of the vampire as his central motif for ideology, we might instead read more into those “phantom shapes” which so entrance Jonathan (53). These are phantom shapes, which like our commodities on the shelves, bedazzle us—commodities which Marx characterizes as congealed forms labor in a state of phantom-like objectivity. And that is to say, to see ideology always takes a great feat of abstraction; it stands beyond the senses. To see the vampire—if it can be done—, to drive a stake through its heart and pin and mark its place (finally).
It is the unseen aspect which draws together the coordinates of the vampire, desire, and ideology. All three stand out of view. All three capture us. What the vampire brings to bear on the other two, as I tried to indicate in the beginning, is a shift of positions. For the vampire, both on the hill and in the mirror, lurks behind our back: “but there was no sign of a man in it, except myself” (32). Being behind one’s back counts as another mark of invisibility, but more importantly, the position is one of intimacy. The vampire shares in our looking out. What I mean to say is that the vampire is emblematic of the modern subject of desire. For in modernity, it is now we ourselves who are out of place, displaced from that orderly chain of being. So much for all the anxiety surrounding logistics and documentation in the novel. Our place is never made definite and visible to us now. Now, this is where the vampire’s invisibility (or non-knowledge) comes to meet its parasitic nature. For, we desire most to find our place (at the side of husband’s? Mere clerk or junior partner?), and such is the nature of both the desire and the vampire that they not be satiated. The vampire is not the double of us in the mirror. It is the double that moves alongside us, spurning and pulling our desire. The vampire is the like inner swerve of our aim, the force moves and guides us yet which we do not know. It stands for the other side of knowing, “a night existence” (32).
<br><br>
To end, a quote from Hegel, who like the vampire always arrives anachronistically, out of joint with its time—the vampire in virtue of its immortality; another case of it not adhering to our sense-making structures of the mind, in this case those temporal ones. For, Hegel already saw the vampire, already described this modern subject of desire in his early Jenaer Realphilosophie stating:
The human being is this night, this empty nothing, that contains everything in its simplicity—an unending wealth of many representations, images, of which none belongs to him—or which are not present. This night, the interior of nature, that exists here—pure self—in phantasmagorical representations, is night all around it, in which here shoots a bloody head—there another white ghastly apparition, suddenly here before it, and just so disappears. One catches sight of this night when one looks human beings in the eye—into a night that becomes awful.
