        <h1 style="color: white;">On the End</h1><p class="posttxt">A family member recently asked me, “When will these protests end?” A question which at first appeals to one as simple, maybe even inappropriately naive, in fact strikes at the core of today’s socio-political predicament. For, is it precisely not the motif of “the end” which constantly plagues the scene of life today? Fundamentalists continually proclaim the “end of days,” Fukuyama’s “end of history” hypothesis, the end of life as presented in the ecological disaster or the COVID virus, optimistic and pessimistic prognostications of the end of capitalism, the end of empire, etc. And now, we in the United States (though it has in recent days launched into an international phenomena), are faced with the question of when shall the protests against police violence end? (or perhaps the more pertinent question being, when will the police violence end?)

<br><br>So, how to end? How does one end? If we are to take the fundamentalist call of the “end of days,”  it seems that one cannot end. For, how many times can fundamentalists proclaim the End? A proclamation which has become motif in itself, so recurrent to the point that it enters into banality. The end never seems to happen then; it is always forestalled until another date; come back another day, and then perhaps nothing shall be here. We could say that the End goes “on end.”

<br><br>Alenka Zupančič insightfully uses the example of quitting (ending) smoking to illustrate two modalities of repetition, and it is precisely repetition and the failure it ensues which concerns this inability to end. For example, a smoker may always hold out in front of them the possibility, the capacity, to end. In their failure to truly quit, they repeat and preserve this very capacity to end. If they were to quit, this capacity would dissipate. The other modality concerns the “last cigarette,” the greatest cigarette. The smoker repeatedly makes out the cigarette in their hand as the finale. They can then repeatedly indulge in their fantasy, in the ecstasy of the final cigarette.

<br><br>Are we then a society of failed (successful?) addicts? Every day is the End but perhaps tomorrow will really be it. But which of the modalities do we correspond to? In “pre-protest” America, we find ourselves in the first. We know that we have the capacity to end or that we are on the precipice of ending. The explosion of the masses into the streets signals a shift into the second modality. Every day is now in fact the End. We are ending. The killing of George Floyd shall be the last, or at least this is the aspirational and wholly admirable sentiment of the protests. There is no doubt a kind of ecstatic energy in the air as well. The question remains whether or not this will in fact be the “final fantasy.”

<br><br>We must then further ask ourselves how might we escape the deadlock of repeating the End? One route is to drop the transcendental characterization of the situation, which resounds in the liberal position. To make this clearer, let us take the examples of resolutions to police violence being articulated. There are clearly two camps emerging. First, is this liberal position, represented in something like Campaign Zero. Activists have come forward with a series of reforms: banning police chokeholds, body cameras, community representation, etc. The other, radical camp, instead makes the demand of police abolition or some variation (defunding the police, etc.). The liberal position seeks to continually work towards some approximation of an Ideal while the radical camp seeks to fundamentally change the coordinates of what policing even means. While the latter position appears to be clearest in fundamentally ending, this still yet provides no answer on escaping the deadlock.

<br><br>In dropping the liberal-transcendetal position, the latter radical position must be further supplemented by the adoption of a “fatalist” disposition. Such a position is best exemplified in Frank Ruda’s Abolishing Freedom: A Plea for the Contemporary Use of Fatalism (2016). It is insightful if we return to Zupančič’s first modality. For, the fatalistic position appears in direct opposition to the first modality. In this case, we could reconfigure the situation as the freedom (capacity) to end; freedom is propped up as choice or possibility. The fatalistic position “abolishes freedom” (freedom as capacity) to arrive a truer notion of freedom:

<br><br>Acting as if I were not free–being a fatalist–I affirm the very determination that I cannot deduce from my capacities, namely that I am forced to make a choice when I seek to be free. But I thereby do not simply become the instrument of the Other, of God’s will; I rather become even more responsible for my deeds as everything is determined but it is fully unclear how […] Assuming this can avoid the type of indifference I outlined; fatalism, the defense of absolute necessity, might be considered to be a tool for a renewal of true (inhuman) humanism. Or simply put: only a fatalist can be free. His or her slogan, his or her guiding line, should be: act as if you were not free.

<br><br>Or following Žižek and Lacan’s logic of the non-All: “the position of true autonomy is not “I am responsible for everything,” but “there is nothing for which I am not responsible”” (Absolute Recoil: 69). What I propose then for the radical actors against police violence, and radicals in general, is to stake out this position of absolute necessity.

<br><br>We do not have the capacity to end police violence, to end systemic racism, to end capitalism. Instead, it is absolutely necessary. There is no choice to be made. The End has already arrived. “Father, can’t you see I’m burning?” The last cigarette has already burnt. The End mustn’t go on end. It is time to End the end. Only then might we begin.
