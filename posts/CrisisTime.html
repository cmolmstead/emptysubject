        <h1 style="color: white;">A Crisis of Time</h1><p class="posttxt">We are often told that we are living in a time of crisis. And this fact is readily confirmed by the catastrophes eclipsing us in the present moment: the coming ecological collapse, the long-fomenting and now bursting forth of racial tensions, the ever-widening gap of economic classes, etc. The tragedy of our day is that, in the recognition of these phenomena, we choose to perceive them as disparate and unconnected ‘happenings’ of the world; they hold no greater or deeper logic as to the cause of their manifesting. The great challenge for thought in any era is to think the events of the day in their totality—that is, to think historically. With this in mind, we might better render the plight of this ‘time of crisis’ through the inversion of such a proclamation. Namely, what we are facing today is a crisis of time.

<br><br>In my last piece, I already found myself wading into temporal waters; it was there that I took up the problematic of ‘the End’ in its various modalities and sought to provide some preliminary markings as to how one goes about ending (e.g. ending violence). The solution centered on the way in which one conceives of the End, i.e. as possibility vs. actuality. On the face of it, the question strikes one in its simplicity, but lurking in it was an even more naive assumption: that one even has ‘an End’ at all. The poverty of our situation is the lack of any temporal schema or ordering—the ability to map anything like a beginning or end in relation to the time-space we occupy. For, who among us, in this time of the COVID-19 virus, has not been dawned with questions such as: ‘what day is it?’, ‘what happened yesterday?’, ‘Is it the next month already?’, etc. Our daily temporality and rhythm have been thrown off kilter and out-of-sync. We are disoriented, caught in a perpetual present, a time of no-time. Our days follow the character of zombies: they limp and lurch along towards us, and when we are away, we are suddenly struck by how quickly they caught up to us again.

<br><br>This disorientation is not limited to individual experience, though. A greater insight lies in realizing the collective nature of this temporal dislocation. At this level analysis though, the zombie image makes for a poor metaphor. The collective experience is rather that of an uncoordinated mess of limbs. While some of us feel dislocated from a time-field, at the collective level, there is also a lack of a unified field. That is, sections of society are all moving at their own rate. For instance, for some there can be no end to the virus because it has not even begun. Then for others, the virus ended a week ago, or two weeks ago, when services and businesses reopened, and they were ushered into the falsehood that it was safe to return to ‘regular’ life. Further yet, some have had the rude awakening to the virus’ presence by finding themselves in a hospital bed (if, as we are seeing in some states now, they are so lucky).

<br><br>While this phenomenon is affecting everyone across the globe, the United States appears to have an acute case. For, in those countries where the virus has been managed decently well (New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, and others), we hear statements from state leadership such as: ‘we must be strong,’ ‘we must confront this virus as a nation,’ ‘we do not know when it will end, but we must persist’, etc. For both these states and the United States, the end of the virus is foreclosed, it cannot be inscribed as an objective point of time, but there is a clear difference. The United States is marked by a proliferation of times while these countries experience a collective disorientation. For these other states, there is at least an image with which to identify and center themselves as opposed to an exploding multitude of heterogeneous timescapes.

<br><br>In surveying what has been said thus far, we should not be so quick to reduce each temporality as species of a wider genus. Or rather, I want to argue that there is at least one species which overdetermines the rest—namely, the time of no-time, the perpetual present:

<br><br>Perhaps what we are seeing is the culmination, or the making concrete, of Francis Fukuyama’s ‘End of History’ thesis—the proclamation that in the nineties history, as a great struggle of forces, had come to an end with the triumph of Western liberal democracy over Soviet state socialism. History has reached its end and is now stalled enacting the endless present we find ourselves in now. Precisely in the moment where history was to meet its telos, its purpose, its goal and end, it has found itself torn asunder. The Fukuyama thesis was always supplemented by the fantasy that even in this stasis of history, there would still be a dynamism—progress could still occur. Only now, though, has not the experience of COVID forced us to have traversed this fantasy? That is, COVID not only renders clearly the debilitation of this time of no-time, but in conjunction with all the other crises, we realize that things cannot go ‘on end’, that this situation is in no way sustainable. The infinity of promised progress in the end of history finds itself tripping over the finite conditions in which it makes its appearance.

<br><br>Slavoj Žižek has already pointed to concerns about foodstuffs and the need for a global-health coordination effort against the virus. We find the most bald example in education. The schoolchildren will have to return to school at some point, and the deadline is quickly approaching. But we all that know school cannot look the same. The COVID-19 virus is pushing us towards the cliff of the current status quo. Things cannot go on the same, and there will have to be major changes to the structure of society and our daily life.

<br><br>For Martin Heidegger, our Being is essentially temporal:

<br><br>The being in being-with-one-another in the world, and that also means in discovering with one another the one world in which we are, is being in the Everyone and a particular kind of temporality. The movements of nature which we define spatio-temporally. . . are encountered ‘in’ time only insofar as their being is discovered as pure nature. They are encountered ‘in’ the time which we ourselves are.
History of the Concept of Time, M. Heidegger

<br><br>Would our situation then mean for Heidegger the total destruction of ourselves? If ‘we ourselves are’ this time, have we now lost ourselves in the current predicament, in our time of no-time? Maybe for Heidegger, but does not our dislocation, the obstacle to a ‘normal’ temporal rhythm, in fact present itself as the solution or our very power in this situation? We are charged with the amazing capacity to step out of time (perhaps we are always disjointed from time in some sense, never fully able to be one with it). Our disorientation shows us that time is not our master nor are we simply this time itself. This ability to ‘pause’, to step out, is precisely what we will need in the coming months and year against the COVID virus: the ability to stop, re-orient ourselves, and yet provide and maintain everyone during such periods. The structural changes necessary will have to institute some kind of societal pause button.

<br><br>The challenge remains though to bring about a collective investment or experience in opposition to the proliferating temporalities in the United States, so that anything like a societal pause button is functional. To overcome such a hurdle will require new vision. If the “end of history” hypothesis has met its limit, then it is time to constitute a new history. A new history, a new historical form, which could provide for the necessary temporal-cognitive mapping to a new future.

<br><br>Each historical form is a totality which encompasses not only its retroactively posited past, but also its own future, a future which is by definition never realized: it is the immanent future of this present, so that, when the present form disintegrates, it undermines also its past and its future.
Less Than Nothing, S. Žižek

<br><br>In this moment, there is both an excess and a lack of time. Our days feel endless and yet catastrophe in its many forms draws closer on the horizon. We must submit what appears as a stepback to being the very lever that pushes us forward: our very disjointedness in timespace. The basic lesson of psychoanalysis is that ‘we are responsible for our dreams.’ If we dream of no future, then we cannot help but be responsible for what follows—nothing. Now is the moment to put the old world to rest and to dream of a new one.
