        <h1 style="color: white;">The Edge of Melancholy</h1><p class="posttxt">“The future is not born at once. It exists in the present. The thing is to know where to look.” —C.L.R. James
<br><br>
The necessity of the New abounds all around. Has its mounting pressure been felt ever so keenly? It beckons to burst, to tear asunder the last remaining suture of this social fabric. It is a New that takes hold in the rot of social decay, seeping through seams which can no longer cover festering wounds. Nonetheless, it is a New that remains stunted, not yet able to emerge. It is here that we last ended too—with the basic psychoanalytic insight that ‘we are responsible for our dreams.’ And further, if we choose not to dream, we can’t help but be responsible for what follows…nothing. But in turning this question over further—the question of the New, a new dream—, it is not that we simply lack a dream. Instead, what looks like a lack of a dream is rather the refusal to give up an old dream.
<br><br>
What we are dealing with is a case of failed mourning or ‘melancholy’ as Freud would have it. We have a societal subject who cannot let go, and a cursory glance at today’s political discourse reveals this; a fact to be found on both sides of the partisan dividing line. The most evident example can be taken from the sloganeering of the Trump campaign. It is of no dispute to state that the program of the Republican Party finds its highest expression in the phrase “Make America Great Again.” The statement holds within it both a past and future, but it is a bankrupt future. Not simply due to the policies which compose its agenda, but the ‘grammar’ of the statement reveals this. This is a grammar much in line with conservative thinking since Edmund Burke, where a conservative future is “the attempt to project a continuous past into the future” (Politics and Vision, Wolin). In the slogan of “Make America Great Again,” we receive a future which is nothing but the past.
<br><br>
On the other side, we have the projections of liberalism, whose mouthpieces are Joe Biden and the Democratic Party. The coordinates of our question can also be located within the Biden campaign’s slogan: “Build Back Better.” The usage of this slogan should come as no surprise, either. For in the entire primary season, the Biden campaign put forward one simple agenda: not Trump. And such an outlook still inheres within this campaign slogan. The Democratic Party slogan also holds a return to the past—the past of the Obama-era, “the Time before Trump.” What we are given is a future which simply lacks Trump; a future which is once again what we (ostensibly) already had. But if this were all, the Democratic Party could be reduced to conservative position elicited above. What matters here is the ‘remainder’ of the slogan, “better.” It is this third term which incarnates the species of liberalism in opposition to the conservative variety. Conservatism is a call for a continuous past. This is why there is fixation on tradition and roots within the ideology. Liberalism, on the other hand, is of a modern character; it is a call for an eternal present (which I have previously spoken of). The Democratic Party wishes to return to the Obama-era, where the “dream” of eternal progress was supposedly unfurling itself. The validity of our suggestion is found in the way liberals measure progress. Progress is not determined by upheavals of society—and the incarnation of the New—, but the sustaining of the current order with marginal adjustments. For instance, the maximal expression of progress is something like a corporate board of an organic juice company whose members are a majority black women or even more mundane, the development of a thinner digital screen.
<br><br>
But what is evident in both cases is the inability to really posit the New. Instead, we are given recycled versions of the past. Not only do both discourses posit the old, but with each, we get a lament of the old. For Lacan, our desire must be supplemented by a fantasy. The desire to return to the past must be supplemented by the fantasy of what this past was like. For each, this is a much more idyllic past too. It is a past which is a kind of Rousseauian state of nature—the time before society’s corrupting influences set in, where a natural moral order reigned, and there could be no sense of an inequality. So to borrow a turn of phrase from Derrida in another context, we could say that what we are dealing with is a Rousseauian melancholy. The dangerous component which accompanies this reactionary thinking is the determination of “what exactly was this past?” and more acutely, “what becomes justified in resurrecting it?.” The results of which we now see playing out all across the United States.
<br><br>
We can track further with Derrida, though. In the same phrase that he invokes Rousseauian melancholy, he places it into opposition with the affirmative joy of Nietzsche. And if one knows anything about Derrida, it is his predilection to subvert oppositions. So in our next stroke, let us be more Derridean than Derrida and take apart this opposition for our own context. Our question now becomes: how can one be both a melancholic and joyful subject? And how is such a condition characteristic of today’s subject?
<br><br>
The answer lies in another pervasive social phenomenon; one that has come to be called toxic positivity. Toxic positivity is the imperative to be positive, happy, and joyful regardless of circumstance. There may be terrible things happening all around, but one should never lose their smile; one should always be grateful; one can always ‘stop and smell the flowers.’ Alenka Zupančič describes a similar perspective which she dubs biomorality—where a happy person is a good person and a sad person is a bad person.
<br><br>
In my view, and counterintuitively, those who exude this kind of positivity are among some of the most traumatized individuals. This subject, split between Rousseauian melancholy and Nietzschean joy, is a disavowing subject. What has become disavowed is the failure of their dream: “I know very well that my dream has failed, but nonetheless… I shall smell the flowers.” And isn’t it precisely those, who take up a “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” mentality, that cannot come to terms with their own failed vision of society? They cannot take up the responsibility of their own failure and instead insulate themselves from the effects of this failure through the cope of positivity and optimism. They cannot come to terms with the crack in their reality and instead pull the veil over their own face. Melancholy is relegated to the role of the unconscious, but it is there in all their statements from the seemingly most opaque exultations of happiness to the most on the face of political slogans.

Like I see so many of you, I too feel the overburdening weight of this moment, the affliction of an anxiety which rears its face around every corner and backgrounds every thought. It appears in all its avatars: ecology, racism, COVID, housing, food supplies. Others are quick to say that we are weak, that we give in to our own self-inflicted trauma. Only, the opposite is true. It is those who days go unbated, who greet each day with unheralded optimism, that are truly traumatized. For, they have become insulated from the pain, cool to the heat of the moment. Let us not pity ourselves then but they who, with a smile, cling to a bankrupt dream which never was and cannot be. It is our anxiety which reveals to us the truth of today. It is our anxiety that signals the death of the old and the precipice of the new; that things cannot, must not, go on the same. But if we learn anything about anxiety from Lacan, anxiety is not a condition of anticipation but when the object comes to close, when it is already upon us. The New is not waiting to be born. The New is now. We need only ‘know where to look’ and to seize it—to seize the impossible so that any world may be possible.
