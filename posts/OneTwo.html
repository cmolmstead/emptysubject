    <div class="container" style="color: white; width: 100%; text-color: white; padding-top: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">
          <img class="postimg" src="../assets/img/media/cube1.gif" />
        <h1 style="color: white;">A One... A Two... A One, Two, Three</h1><p class="posttxt">The entire history of philosophy could be read and reorganized according to a simple matrix:
<br><br>
First, those who aim at One: This seems evident. After all, in its original intention philosophy sought to get to the underlying substance of all things. Thales declared everything to be water, Democritus proposed the atom as the basic unit of everything, and centuries later Spinoza would declare everything to be of singular substance.
<br><br>
Second, those who aim at Two: The figure of the two commonly takes the forms of dualism such as the mind-body (e.g. Descartes) or self-other distinctions (e.g. Levinas). Such dualisms can also be infused with qualitative, moral value:  good-evil, sacred-profane.
<br><br>
Third, those who aim for Three: Maybe there’s something to be made of the Pythagorean penchant for the triangle, but the classic misreading of Hegel’s dialectic as a teleological trio of steps towards resolution or synthesis would probably be the most common example. Instead though, I would shift the perspective on this third and point to the work of 20th century thought; for example, Lacan’s knot of symbolic, imaginary, and real. Deleuze even points to the idea of a third order being essential for many of the thinkers in the second-half of the 20th century—diverse as they are and in varied rivalries they may be. This is a third which is not the same as the other two, a third which emerges in between a two. Perhaps, it is the environment in which two encounter one another. Or it could be the point of irreducibility between the two taken ‘as such,’ as an object of possible conceptual contemplation. This would be the point of a minimal demarcation or distinction, its character is that of a limit. So much has been made of this third qua irreducibility in contemporary philosophy.
<br><br>
And finally, Four? Who thinks in four’s? And what can we get from four that would not already be in two? The thinker who comes to mind is the linguist Greimas and his semiotic square hits the mark. Greimas’s square makes apparent differences which cannot be captured in a dualistic model. It’s quite simple to demonstrate: In dualism, we have something like A or Not-A or A v. B (a selection between two). Dualism fails to account for something like the full semantic color of our reality though. Take for instance: alive vs. dead. Things can be alive or dead… but our minds know that such other worlds are possible. That is, are there things that are non-alive and non-dead. For instance, vampires are living death and zombies are the undead. The case of four performs a kind of transformation or permutation of the dualism—in a way, inverting the two poles in on themselves. There’s really no set rule on how to apply this multiplication though.
