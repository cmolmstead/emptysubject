    <div class="container" style="color: white; width: 100%; text-color: white; padding-top: 15px; margin-top: 0px;">
          <img class="postimg2" src="../assets/img/lacanex.jpg" />
        <h1 style="color: white;">Your, Your Ex, & Lacan</h1><p class="posttxt">When Lacan is examining the techniques of Freud in his Seminar I, he tries to bring psychoanalysis into relief against traditional therapy which would posit that in the analytic setting, there are two (the doctor and the patient). Lacan maintains that there is always a third involved. This third is something like the symbolic ground which both act in reference to, a virtual entity, the Big Other.
<br><br>
There is often a joke form about sexual consent which goes something like: ‘yes, he has consented, and she has consented, but has Jesus?’ I think it is funnier when Jesus is replaced by Mao but this is not the point… The point is of this third other also having its due, and sex is not possible until this symbolic other also agrees. After all, isn’t that what marriage by Church is meant to signify? This is to say that we never directly encounter one another. All our speech is mediated by and in some sense directed at or with a third.
<br><br>
A similar logic applies to social media posts which purport to give life advice. Consider: just how many times have you seen some kitschy post, often with horrendous font selection, about how you need to stop caring about what others think of you. Who is this message for? Is it really just a simple act of communication, of informational exchange, between sender and receiver? One of Lacan’s aphorisms fits perfectly here: a letter always arrives at its destination. It arrives because the message to be sent is for the sender themselves. We all know this ‘clinical case.’ Someone goes through a break up and soon they become a social media mouthpiece spewing life advice about freedom, self-worth, living your life to the fullest, and all the other classical tropes.
<br><br>
But why is there a further need to be posted publicly? These ‘private messages’ are required to be social in that they function at all. It is not enough to really believe that one is what they purport themselves be. It must also be registered with this symbolic other. These public postings are a kind of socially made self-affirmation, a social registration that I am the one I am. We never find full affirmation, though. This is why there are repeated attempts, repeated declarations. We can never be totally at one with what we suppose we are. What we effectively are is this repeated failure of self-positings.
<br><br>
Returning to the example of the posts, the one who is posting of self-worth is one who has just been dislocated from the security of the question, i.e. a breakup, an unlinking from the other. This is not to make a value-judgment of such posts or to degrade them in anyway. They are kinds of speech-acts of recovery in the face of loss. But also perhaps, they are symptoms of unhealthy relationships. But this is not the point: The point is to discern the logic of what is happening, that of the necessity of the third to provide a guarantee. Even between you and yourself, another must agree, must also know.
<br><br>
Now one may say that we have misread the situation in some way. That in fact, these are not messages to the self but very much for the other. To say it in the most colloquial: subtweets. I would argue that it still caught within the third. The kinds of posts we have referred to have a secondary meaning beyond their surface appearance:
<br><br>
‘I am saying that I have self-worth’ /
‘to say that I do not need you’
<br><br>
But if you truly did not need this person, you would need not say that you need them. Your proof is evident in the fact that you feel the need to communicate this at all. The key to bringing this third out is to consider even if someone really consciously believes this to be the case. Your actions prove contrary to the course: ‘why this incessant need to say so?’ Who are you saying this for? You are again speaking to this impersonal social Other. There must be this minimal symbolic marking, this re-touching of affirmation. Belief is always required to be hooked onto an other, without this other, it loses support.
<br><br>
To conclude, the psychoanalytic joke of the chicken:
<br><br>
A man enters the clinic and he is taken away for treatment on account of believing himself to be a piece of corn. Through treatment, he no longer believes that he is a piece of corn. Upon leaving the clinic, he encounters a chicken and fearfully returns to the clinic. The doctors are very confused. ‘Why are you afraid? You know that you are no longer a seed?’ He replies, ‘I know, but does the chicken know it too?’
